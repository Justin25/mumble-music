# mumble-music

This is a simple music bot for Mumble written because all the others required too much setup work.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed to a location accessible by your PATH variable.
2. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`, open with a text editor, and edit the settings to your liking
3. Run `npm install` and `npm start`
4. Enjoy!
